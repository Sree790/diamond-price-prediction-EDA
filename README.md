# Diamond Price Prediction - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## Overview
This project explores and analyzes the [Diamonds Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hrokrin/the-largest-diamond-dataset-currely-on-kaggle) to uncover trends, patterns, and insights that influence diamond prices. The analysis includes data cleaning, feature analysis, and visualization.

## Key Insights
- **Carat Weight**: Strongest correlation with price.
- **Cut**: Round cut diamonds tend to be more expensive.
- **Color**: Colorless diamonds are priced higher than fancy color diamonds.
- **Clarity**: Higher clarity grades (e.g., IF, VVS1) are more expensive.
- **Fancy Color**: Fancy color diamonds with higher intensity are significantly more expensive.

## Workflow
1. **Data Cleaning**: Handled missing values, removed duplicates, and addressed outliers.
2. **Feature Analysis**: Investigated the impact of features like carat weight, cut, color, and clarity.
3. **Visualization**: Created plots (e.g., scatterplots, violin plots, box plots) to illustrate key findings.

## Final Report

## Next Steps
The insights from this EDA were used to build a predictive model. [View the Modeling Project here; update link].
